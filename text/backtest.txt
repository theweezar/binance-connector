create library to perform back test and plot following instruction:
- use `python-fire` library so script can work on CLI.
- class's entered `fire.Fire` method, is named `Back_Test_CLI`.
- create Back_Test_CLI's method `compute`.
- method `compute` has 1 arguments: `source`.
- get data frame by `file.get_source(source)`.
- data frame already has indicators needed.
- perform back test following conditions and instruction:
    - when long: `df["rsi_6_of_low"]` < 40.
    - when short: `df["rsi_6_of_high"]` > 85.
    - set `position`: long is 1, short is 0, not matching is '-', to the matched rows.
- plot the data frame following instruction:
    - plot the last 1000 rows.
    - plot the marker if `position` exists, red marker for short position, green marker for long position
